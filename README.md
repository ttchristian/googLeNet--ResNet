## ðŸ“Œ Description

This repository contains my personal implementation of classic convolutional neural networks, including **GoogLeNet (Inception v1)** and **ResNet** architectures, from scratch using PyTorch.  

The purpose is to better understand:
- model architecture
- forward/backward propagation
- performance evaluation

and to serve as a baseline for future research in image recognition and deep learning.
